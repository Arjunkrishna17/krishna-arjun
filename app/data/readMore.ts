      "<p>Engineering metrics is part of Axon project, it is a software development analytics software, designed specifically for engineering and business leaders. With Axon, you can gain a comprehensive view of your organization's engineering efforts, without any additional work or changes in your existing processes. Prepare to make better decisions with relevant real-time data at your fingertips!</p><p>I've developed an Insight Dashboard as part of this initiative, which intelligently highlights areas that require your attention, allowing you to focus on what matters most. You can drill down to uncover the root cause when necessary. I've implemented a separate backend service for this using Node.js and Express.js. This service is hosted on AWS using GitHub Actions.</p><p>Furthermore, I've created an Engineering Dashboard based on DORA metrics, which include Cycle Time, Deployment Time, and Mean Time to Recovery. These metrics offer leaders valuable insights into their software development and delivery processes. By closely monitoring these metrics, leaders can identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, enabling them to proactively address issues and optimize workflows. All user interface design was created by me, utilizing React Js, Tailwind CSS, Recharts, and Figma.</p>",
